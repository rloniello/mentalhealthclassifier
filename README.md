# Sentiment Classification for Mental Health Status

## Abstract

Determining an individuals mental health status based on text alone is a complex problem for machines and people. In this document I explore the use of sentiment classification to classify a particular text string into a category of various mental health statuses that represent a wide range of normal and abnormal mental health states. I show a proof of concept workflow with the dataset [Sentiment Analysis for Mental Health](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suchintikasarkar/sentiment-analysis-for-mental-health) using Create ML and standard R workflow proceedures. Discussion continues with the sentiment classification of public forms, interpersonal messages, news articles and more using similar methods.
